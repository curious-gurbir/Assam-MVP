# Assam-MVP
Inventory Mangement System

## Structure of the project

- Admin Panel Frontend is made using Adobe Muse (Avoid using it for front end in projects that are going to have heavy backend, due to numerous restrictions)
- `Add Station` and `Edit` features are made from scratch using web languages
- Backend DB is optimized for long term use along with DB Normalization (Only admin portion is ready)
- Project is 55% finished, with only admin portion, station part is not added
- Only MySQL is used to store DB Data (Firebase is only preferable for short info passage that needs to be updated in real time)
- PHP and AJAX are used to handle backend
- Javascript and Jquery are majorly used to handle front-end
- Final output can be completed in a way that would be able to handle most types of inventory records
- DB structure is inspired by Discord
- DataTable plugin is used in 'Stations' page but due to lack of complete customization the 'Edit Table' is completely made from scratch
- Dashboard is not linked with backend, that requires completion of 'Station' panel
