# Assam-MVP
Inventory Mangement System

## Structure of the project

- Admin Panel Frontend is made using Adobe Muse (Avoid using it for front end in projects that are going to have heavy backend, due to numerous restrictions)
- `Add Station` and `Edit` features are made from scratch using web languages
- Backend DB is optimized for long term use along with DB Normalization (Only admin portion is ready)
- Project is 55% finished, with only admin portion, station part is not added
- Only MySQL is used to store DB Data (Firebase is only preferable for short info passage that needs to be updated in real time)
- PHP and AJAX are used to handle backend
- Javascript and Jquery are majorly used to handle front-end
- Final output can be completed in a way that would be able to handle most types of inventory records
- DB structure is inspired by Discord
- DataTable plugin is used in 'Stations' page but due to lack of complete customization the 'Edit Table' is completely made from scratch
- Dashboard is not linked with backend, that requires completion of 'Station' panel
- QR Code serial key for each item can be implement in this module
- Everytime a personnel have to use generally restricted inventory, the QR code can be scanned to get permission from superior
- Budget and alert systems can improve the analysis of data in a lot more effecient ways

## About completion of project
> Most of the efforts were focused upon developing a new way that can change the way inventory is handled. Every time a lot of issues show up due to lack of care in a balanced task like keeping record of things. Some people misuse the official things without even facing any lawsuit later on, this system can get rid of most of those situations by alotting a unique QR and String ID to each item and by keeping track of each change made in database from each portal. Even if it isn't completed but this module can be further used for refernece to build up better versions of it.
